			<p>With a formal education in <a class="inline" href="http://www.brunel.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/product-design-bsc#" title="Overview of Brunel University's Product Design course">Product Design</a>, I was fortunate to gain an amazing grounding in design, not only from a creative perspective, but also a commercial one as well.</p>

			<p>For me, the success of any product or service lies with finding the right balance between the two; combining aesthetic beauty and ease of use with the realities of commercial viability.</p>
			
			<p>I believe <strong>design should be an evidence based process built on good up-front research</strong>, tested and iterated on throughout the design phase, followed by continual measurement post release.</p>
			
			<blockquote>
				"Good design doesn't stem from intuition, talent, or luck (although I'll take a smidgen of each). It comes from research and understanding."
				</br>
				<i class="source">&mdash; Mike Monterio, co-founder and design director of <a class="inline" href="http://www.muledesign.com">Mule Design</a>.</i>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>I'm also a big <strong>advocate of making digital products and services that are accessible to all</strong>. When done well, they can play a large part in the lives of those with physical and cognitive disabilities, offering the opportunity for greater independence and social equality. Something, I think, that's worthwhile doing.</p>
