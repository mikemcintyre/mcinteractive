			<p>With RBS seeing an ever increasing number of customers turning to mobile devices for their banking needs, it has become imperative for the bank to ensure the services they offer are available across all channels.</p>
			<p>As part of a small design team, I worked directly with product owners and in-house development teams to regularly release new mobile app features and improve existing ones.</p>

			<h2 id="appraoch">Approach</h2>
			<p>Following an initial project briefing we'd work with the product owner to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understand core business objectives</li>
				<li>Explore how the service was currently being used on other channels</li>
				<li>Speak with customer service representatives about problems being reported by customers</li>
				<li>Discuss possible design constraints with the technical teams</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Using this research, we'd move on to drafting design solutions by starting to define process flows, sketching out inteface ideas and drawing up initial wireframes.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>In the vast majority of cases these would be done across all supported operating systems: iOS (iPhone and iPad), Android and Windows 10 for phone.</p>

			<p>Knowing some customers access their online banking from multiple devices, we always looked to create solutions that functioned consistently across platforms, yet were familiar and in keeping with the operating system.</p>
			<p>As our concepts began to take shape we would then transfer them into interactive prototypes.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>With the internal RBS development team working to an Agile process with monthly development cycles, we'd take our concepts in to their weekly planning meetings. This allowed them to have a regular sight of our work, continually assess and refine their build estimates and provide us with early feedback regards any technical implications.</p>

			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>Each release of the mobile banking app has seen a significant increase in the number of services and features available to its users, making it more and more the channel of choice for all customers' banking needs.</p>
			<p>This, combined with the continuing improvements in usability, has resulted in a steady progress in the overall customer experience, with the latest release for NatWest achieving its first 5 star ratings from customers on the iTunes store.</p>
			<p>Most recently Natwest was <a class="inline" href="https://smartmoneypeople.com/news/post/british-bankawards-2017-winners">awarded best banking app</a> in the British Bank Awards 2017, run by Smart Money People:</p>
			<blockquote>
				"...NatWest's offering is probably the most well-rounded, customer-focussed, and popular app of this list. With swathes of functionality, a great user experience, and great customer reviews..."

			</blockquote>
			<p>Our work in partnership with the <abbr title="Royal National Institute of Blind People">RNIB</abbr> on improving the overall accessibility also saw the app become the first in the UK banking industry to receive 'RNIB Approved' accreditation. A significant step forward in ensuring a service that is truly accessible to all. It even attracted coverage from the BBC:</p>
